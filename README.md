# SuperYield
SuperYield project

Main idea behind Super Yield:
- Customers can select from various investment types and purchase "shares" of that type
- Customers can trade their shares as desired
- Each available investment has a expiration when share holders receive cash
- The console app runs nightly to update share values and create a daily report
- Investment types include merchant lending, pre-settlement funding, and real estate
- On the backend, SY venture capitalists find investments and create shares for distribution

The SY project is ASP.NET MVC with a SQL server backend
